WELL, WHILE YOU'RE|THINKING ABOUT THAT I'D LIKE TO BRING|THE DUCK IN HERE AND ASK HER,|IF POSSIBLE TO CLARIFY THE WHOLE QUESTION|OF CURRENCY RESTRICTIONS AND CUSTOM REGULATIONS|IN THE WORLD TODAY.

CHECK.
( heavy thumping andpounding ) DOOR'S OPEN.
OH, YEAH.
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,|ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.
MY NAME'S POLICE|CONSTABLE HENRY THATCHER AND THIS IS A RAID.
I HAVE REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE|CERTAIN SUBSTANCES ON THE PREMISES.
( constable sniffing ) WHAT SORT OF|SUBSTANCES, OFFICER? ER, CERTAIN SUBSTANCES.
WELL, WHAT SORT OF|CERTAIN SUBSTANCES? ER, CERTAIN SUBSTANCES|OF AN ILLICIT NATURE.
COULD YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC?? I BEG YOUR PARDON? COULD YOU BE CLEARER? OH, OH, YEAH.
CERTAIN SUBSTANCES|ON THE PREMISES TO BE REMOVED|FOR CLINICAL TESTS.
HAVE YOU GOT ANYTHING|PARTICULAR IN MIND? WELL, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? NOTHING, OFFICER.
YOU ARE SANDY CAMP, THE ACTOR? YES.
I MUST WARN YOU, SIR THAT OUTSIDE I HAVE|POLICE DOG JOSEPHINE WHO IS NOT ONLY ARMED AND TRAINED TO SNIFF OUT|CERTAIN SUBSTANCES BUT IS ALSO A JUNKIE.

" ( laughter ) WELL, I THINK THEY SHOULD|ATTACK THINGS LIKE THAT WITH SATIRE.
I MEAN, NED SHERRIN.
FAIR'S FAIR.
I THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE ABLE TO|MAKE UP THEIR OWN MINDS FOR ME.
WELL, I THINK THEY SHOULD ATTACK THE FUDDY-DUDDY ATTITUDES|OF THE LOWER MIDDLE CLASSES WHICH PERMIT THE ESTABLISHMENT|TO SURVIVE AND KEEP THE MORES|OF THE WHOLE COUNTRY BACK WHERE THEY WERE|IN THE 19th CENTURY AND THE GHASTLY DAYS OF|THE PRESEXUAL REVOLUTION.
WELL, THAT'S,|ER, VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE, ER, I AM, IN FACT,|MADE ENTIRELY OF WOOD.
WELL, I THINK THEY SHOULD|ATTACK THE LOWER CLASSES FIRST WITH BOMBS AND ROCKETS,|DESTROYING THEIR HOMES AND THEN WHEN THEY RUN|HELPLESS INTO THE STREETS MOWING THEM DOWN|WITH MACHINE GUNS.
AND THEN, OF COURSE,|RELEASING THE VULTURES.
I KNOW THESE VIEWS|AREN'T POPULAR BUT I HAVE NEVER|COURTED POPULARITY.
I THINK THERE SHOULD|BE MORE RACE PREJUDICE.
LESS.
LESS RACE PREJUDICE.

( laughter ) BUT I WOULD LIKE TO ASSURE YOU THAT YOU'D NEVER|BE TREATED LIKE THAT IF YOU HAD AN INTERVIEW HERE|AT THE CAREERS ADVISORY BOARD.
PERHAPS I SHOULD|INTRODUCE MYSELF.
I AM THE HEAD OF THE|CAREERS ADVISORY BOARD.
I WANTED TO BE A DOCTOR,|BUT THERE WE ARE.
I'M HEAD OF|THE CAREERS ADVISORY BOARD.
OR A SCULPTOR--|SOMETHING ARTISTIC.
OR AN ENGINEER,|WITH ALL THOSE DAMS BUT THERE WE ARE, IT'S NO|USE CRYING OVER SPILT MILK.
THE FACTS ARE THERE|AND THAT'S THAT.
I'M THE HEAD|OF THIS LOUSY BOARD.
( sobbing ) NEVER MIND.
( laughter ) NOW, I WONDER IF YOU'VE|EVER CONSIDERED WHAT A VERY PROFITABLE|LINE OF WORK THIS MAN IS IN.
