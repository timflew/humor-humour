GOOD AFTERNOON.
AFTERNOON.
AH LOVELY DAY, ISN'T IT? AR 'TIS THAT.
ARE YOU HERE ON HOLIDAY OR? NO, NO, I LIVE HERE.
OH, JOLLY GOOD.
I SAY, THOSE ARE SHEEP, AREN'T THEY? AR.
YES, YES, OF COURSE, I THOUGHT SO.
ONLY WHY ARE THEY UP IN THE TREES? A FAIR QUESTION AND ONE THA IN RECENT WEEKS HAS BEEN MUCH ON MY MIND.
IT IS MY CONSIDERED OPINION THAT THEY'RE NESTING.
NESTING? LIKE BIRDS? AR EXACTLY.
BIRDS IS THE KEY TO THE WHOLE PROBLEM.
IT'S MY BELIEF THAT THESE SHEEP ARE LABORING UNDER THE MISAPPREHENSION THAT THEY'RE BIRDS.
OBSERVE THEIR BEHAVIOR.
TAKE FOR A STAR THE SHEEP'S TENDENCY TO HOP ABOUT THE FIELD ON THEIR BACK LEGS.
NOW WITNESS THEIR ATTEMPTS TO FLY FROM TREE TO TREE.
NOTICE THEY DO NO SO MUCH FLY AS PLUMMET.
OBSERVE, FOR EXAMPLE, THAT EWE IN THAT OAK TREE.
SHE IS CLEARLY TRYING TO TEACH HER LAMB TO FLY.
TALK ABOUT THE BLIND LEADING THE BLIND.
BUT WHY DO THEY THINK THEY'RE BIRDS? ANOTHER FAIR QUESTION.
ONE THING IS FOR SURE: A SHEEP IS NO A CREATURE OF THE AIR.
IT HAS ENORMOUS DIFFICULTY IN THE COMPARATIVELY SIMPLE ACT OF PERCHING.
AS YOU SEE.
AS FOR FLIGHT, ITS BODY IS TOTALLY UNADAPTED TO THE PROBLEMS OF AVIATION.
TROUBLE IS, SHEEP ARE VERY DIM.
AND ONCE THEY GET AN IDEA INTO THEIR HEADS THERE'S NO SHIFTING IT.
BUT WHERE DO THEY GE THE IDEA FROM? FROM HAROLD.
HE'S THAT SHEEP OVER THERE UNDER THE ELM.
HE'S THAT MOST DANGEROUS OF ANIMALS A CLEVER SHEEP.
HE'S THE RINGLEADER.
HE'S REALIZED THE SHEEP'S LIFE CONSISTS OF STANDING AROUND FOR A FEW MONTHS AND THEN BEING EATEN.
AND THAT'S A DEPRESSING PROSPEC FOR AN AMBITIOUS SHEEP.
HE'S PATENTLY HI ON THE IDEA OF ESCAPE.
BUT WHY DON'T YOU JUS GET RID OF HAROLD? BECAUSE OF THE ENORMOUS COMMERCIAL POSSIBILITIES SHOULD HE SUCCEED.
Man: AND WHAT EXACTLYARE THE COMMERCIAL POSSIBILITIES OF A VINE A VIATION? BON SOIR.

LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I HAVE IN THIS BOX 23 WHITE MICE MICE WHICH HAVE BEEN PAINSTAKINGLY TRAINED OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS TO SQUEAK AT A SELECTED PITCH.
THIS IS E-SHARP.

Man: OH, MY GOD! OH, STOP HIM! STOP HIM! FOR GOD'S SAKE, STOP HIM! NEXT.
ARE YOU THE MARRIAGE GUIDANCE COUNSELOR? YES GOOD MORNING.
Man: MORNING, SIR.
AND GOOD MORNING TO YOU, MADAM.
NAME? MR.
AND MRS.
ARTHUR PEWTEY PEWTEY.
AND WHAT IS THE NAME OF YOUR RAVISHING WIFE? WAIT! DON'T TELL ME.
IT'S SOMETHING TO DO WITH MOONLIGHT.
IT GOES WITH HER EYES.
IT'S SOFT AND GENTLE, WARM AND YIELDING DEEPLY LYRICAL AND YE TENDER AND FRIGHTENED LIKE A TINY WHITE RABBIT.
IT'S DEIRDRE.
DEIRDRE WHAT A BEAUTIFUL NAME.
WHAT A BEAUTIFUL, BEAUTIFUL NAME.
AND WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE TROUBLE WITH YOUR MARRIAGE, MR.
PEWTEY? WELL, IT ALL STARTED ABOUT FIVE YEARS AGO.
WE STARTED GOING ON HOLIDAY TO BRIGHTON TOGETHER.
DEIRDRE, THAT'S MY WIFE, HAS ALWAYS BEEN A VERY GOOD COMPANION TO ME.
I NEVER PARTICULARLY ANTICIPATED ANY MARITAL STRIFE.
INDEED, THE VERY IDEA OF CONSULTING A PROFESSIONAL MARITAL ADVISOR HAS ALWAYS BEEN OF THE GREATEST REPUGNANCE TO ME.
ALTHOUGH, FAR BE IT FROM ME TO IMPUGN THE NATURE OF YOUR TRADE OR PROFESSION.
DO GO ON.
WELL, AS I SAY, WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN GOOD FRIENDS SHARING THE INTERESTS, THE GARDENING AND SO ON THE MODEL AIRPLANES THE SIXPENNY BOTTLE FOR THE HOLIDAY MONEY AND, INDEED, TWICE IN THE MONTH SETTING DOWN IN THE EVENING TO DO THE ACCOUNTS SOMETHING WHICH DEIRDRE DEIRDRE, THAT'S MY WIFE PARTICULARLY LOOKED FORWARD TO ON ACCOUNT OF HER FEET.
I SHOULD PROBABLY HAVE SAID AT THE OUTSE THAT I'M NOTED FOR HAVING SOMETHING OF A SENSE OF HUMOR ALTHOUGH I'VE KEPT MYSELF PRETTY MUCH TO MYSELF OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS NOTWITHSTANDING, AS IT WERE.
AND IT'S ONLY BEEN COMPARATIVELY RECENTLY THAT I'VE BEGUN TO REALIZE WELL, PERHAPS "REALIZE" IS NOT THE CORRECT WORD.
IMAGINE IMAGINE THAT I WAS NO THE ONLY THING IN HER LIFE.
YOU SUSPECTED YOUR WIFE? WELL, YES YES.
AT FIRST, FRANKLY, YES.
HER BEHAVIOR DID SEEM AT THE TIME TO ME WHO WAS, AFTER ALL, THERE TO SEE TO BE A LITTLE ODD.
ODD? YES, WELL, I MEAN, TO A CERTAIN EXTENT, YES.
I'M NOT BY NATURE A SUSPICIOUS PERSON FAR FROM IT.
I HAVE SOMETHING OF A REPUTATION AS AN AFTER-DINNER SPEAKER, IF YOU TAKE MY MEANING.
YES, I CERTAINLY DO.
ANYWAY, IN THE AREA WHERE I'M KNOWN PEOPLE, IN FACT, KNOW ME EXTREMELY WELL.
RIGHT.
WILL YOU HOLD THIS? THANK YOU.
YES ANYWAY, AS I SAID I MUST LEARN TO FACE UP TO THE FACTS STOP BEATING ABOUT THE BUSH OR I'D NEVER LOOK MYSELF IN THE BATHROOM MIRROR AGAIN.
ANYWAY, SO WOULD YOU MIND RUNNING ALONG FOR TEN MINUTES? NO, NO.
MAKE IT HALF AN HOUR.
YES, I'LL WAIT OUTSIDE, SHALL I? YES, WELL, THAT'S PERHAPS THE BEST THING, YES.
CERTAINLY PUT MY MIND AT REST ON ON ONE OR TWO POINTS THERE.
NOW, WAI THERE, STRANGER.
A MAN CAN RUN AND RUN FOR YEAR AFTER YEAR.
TILL HE REALIZES THAT WHAT HE'S RUNNING FROM IS HISSELF.
GOSH! NOW, A MAN'S GOT TO DO WHAT A MAN'S GOT TO DO AND THERE AIN' NO SENSE IN RUNNING.
NOW, YOU GOT TO TURN AND YOU GOT TO FIGH AND YOU GOT TO HOLD YOUR HEAD UP HIGH.
YES! NOW, YOU GO BACK IN THERE, MY SON AND BE A MAN.
WALK TALL.
YES.
OH, I WILL! I WILL! I'VE BEEN PUSHED AROUND LONG ENOUGH.
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS YOUR MOMENT, ARTHUR PEWTEY.
THIS IS IT, ARTHUR PEWTEY.
AT LAST YOU'RE A MAN! ALL RIGHT, DEIRDRE, COME OUT OF THERE! Counselor: GO AWAY! RIGHT, RIGHT.

THAT'S A FULL WORKING DAY, LAD! AND DON'T YOU FORGET IT! OH, DON'T SHOU AT THE BOY, FATHER.
HAMPSTEAD WASN'T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU, WAS IT? YOU HAD TO GO PONCING OFF TO BARNSLEY.

COAL MINING IS A WONDERFUL THING, FATHER.
BUT IT'S SOMETHING YOU'LL NEVER UNDERSTAND.

I'M ALL RIGHT, I'M ALL RIGHT, WOMAN.
JUST GET HIM OUT OF HERE! OH, KEN, YOU'D BETTER GO.

DESTRUCTION, DEFACEMEN HAS GOT TO BE PUT TO AN END.
THIS COUNTRY IS NOT STANDING FOR VANDALS AND HOOLIGANS RUNNING ABOUT.
Man in high voice: OH, YES, THAT'S MUCH BETTER.
OH, ISN'T HE A LOVELY LITTLE OH, ISN'T HE A LOVELY LITTLE OH, ISN'T HE A LOVELY LITTLE Man: WAIT A MINUTE, BUCKAROOS.
THIS HAS GONE FAR ENOUGH.
LOOK OUT! GET AWAY FROM ME! YES, THE MOUSE PROBLEM.
THIS WEEK, THE WORLD AROUND US LOOKS AT THE GROWING SOCIAL PHENOMENON OF MICE AND MEN.
WHAT MAKES A MAN WANT TO BE A MOUSE? WELL, UH, IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF WANTING TO BE A MOUSE.
IT JUST SORT OF HAPPENS TO YOU.
ALL OF A SUDDEN, YOU REALIZE THAT'S WHA YOU WANT TO BE.
AND WHEN DID YOU FIRST NOTICE THESE, SHALL WE SAY, TENDENCIES? WELL, I WAS ABOUT 17 AND SOME MATES AND ME WENT TO A PARTY AND, UH, WELL, WE HAD QUITE A LOT TO DRINK AND THEN SOME OF THE FELLOWS THERE STARTED HANDING CHEESE AROUND.
WELL, JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, I TRIED A BIT AND WELL, THAT WAS THAT.
YES, AND WHAT ELSE DID THESE FELLOWS DO? WELL, UH, SOME OF THEM STARTED DRESSING UP AS MICE A BIT.
UM AND THEN WHEN THEY GOT THE COSTUMES ON, THEY STARTED SQUEAKING.
WAS THAT ALL? THAT WAS ALL.
AND WHAT WAS YOUR REACTION TO THIS? WELL, I WAS SHOCKED.
YES.
BUT, UH GRADUALLY I CAME TO FEEL THAT I WAS MORE AT EASE WITH OTHER MICE.
A TYPICAL CASE, WHOM WE SHALL REFER TO AS MR.
"A.
" ALTHOUGH HIS REAL NAME IS THIS.
WHAT IS IT THAT ATTRACTS SOMEONE LIKE MR.
"A" TO THIS WAY OF LIFE? I HAVE WITH ME A CONSULTANT PSYCHIATRIST.
WELL, WE'VE JUST HEARD A TYPICAL CASE HISTORY.
I MYSELF HAVE OVER 700 SIMILAR HISTORIES, ALL FULLY DOCUMENTED.
WOULD YOU CARE TO CHOOSE ONE? MR ARTHUR ALDRIDGE OF LIVINGTON.
WELL, THAT'S AMAZING.
THANK YOU.
AMAZING THANK YOU, JANET.
KARGOL, SPEAKING AS A PSYCHIATRIS AS OPPOSED TO A CON JURER OH.
WHAT MAKES CERTAIN MEN WANT TO BE MICE? WELL, WE PSYCHIATRISTS HAVE FOUND THAT OVER EIGHT PERCEN OF THE POPULATION WILL ALWAYS BE MICE.
I MEAN, AFTER ALL, THERE'S SOMETHING OF THE MOUSE IN ALL OF US.
I MEAN, HOW MANY OF US CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER, HE HASN'T FELT SEXUALLY ATTRACTED TO MICE? I KNOW I HAVE.
I MEAN, MOST NORMAL ADOLESCENTS GO THROUGH A STAGE OF SQUEAKING TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY.
MOST YOUNGSTERS, ON THE OTHER HAND SOME YOUNGSTERS, ARE ATTRACTED TO I BY ITS VERY ILLEGALITY.
IT'S LIKE MURDER.
MAKE A THING ILLEGAL, AND IT ACQUIRES A MYSTIQUE.
LOOK AT ARSON.
I MEAN, HOW MANY OF US CAN HONESTLY SAY THAT AT ONE TIME OR ANOTHER HE HASN'T SET FIRE TO SOME GREAT PUBLIC BUILDING? I KNOW I HAVE.
THE ONLY WAY, THE ONLY WAY TO BRING THE CRIME FIGURES DOWN IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF OFFENSES.
GET IT OUT IN THE OPEN.
I KNOW I HAVE.
HMM THE AMAZING KARGOL AND JANET.
WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT A MOUSE, ONCE ACCEPTED CAN FULFILL A VERY USEFUL ROLE IN SOCIETY.
INDEED, THERE ARE EXAMPLES THROUGHOUT HISTORY OF FAMOUS MEN NOW KNOWN TO HAVE BEEN MICE.
VENI, VIDI, VICI.
AND OF COURSE, HILAIRE BELLOC.
BUT WHAT IS THE ATTITUDE OF THE MAN IN THE STREE TOWARDS THIS GROWING SOCIAL PROBLEM? I'M DOWN ON THEM.
I'D STRANGLE THEM.
WELL, SPEAKING AS A MEMBER OF THE STOCK EXCHANGE I WOULD SUCK THEIR BRAINS OU WITH A STRAW SELL THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS AND GO INTO SOUTH AMERICAN ZINC.
YEAH, I'D STUFF SPARROWS DOWN THEIR THROATS UNTIL THE BEAKS STUCK OU THROUGH THE STOMACH WALLS.
OH, WELL, I'M A CHARTERED ACCOUNTAN AND CONSEQUENTLY TOO BORING TO BE OF INTEREST.
I FEEL THAT THESE POOR, UNFORTUNATE PEOPLE SHOULD BE FREE TO LIVE THE LIVES OF THEIR OWN CHOICE.
I'D, UH, SPLIT THEIR NOSTRILS OPEN WITH A BOAT HOOK, I THINK.
OH, WELL, I MEAN, THEY CAN'T HELP IT, CAN THEY? BUT, I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO ABOUT I SO I'D KILL THEM.
CLEARLY THE BRITISH PUBLIC'S VIEW IS A HOSTILE ONE.
HOSTILE.
BUT PERHAPS THIS IS BECAUSE SO LITTLE IS GENERALLY KNOWN OF THESE MICE MEN.
WE HAVE SOME FILM NOW TAKEN AT ONE OF THE NOTORIOUS WEEKEND MOUSE PARTIES WHERE THESE DISGUSTING LITTLE PERVERTS MEET.
MR.
"A" TELLS US WHAT ACTUALLY GOES ON AT THESE MOUSE PARTIES.
WELL, UH, FIRST OF ALL YOU GET SHOWN TO YOUR OWN PRIVATE HOLE IN THE SKIRTING BOARD.
THEN YOU PU THE MOUSE SKIN ON UH THEN YOU SCURRY INTO THE MAIN ROOM AND PERHAPS TAKE A RUN IN THE WHEEL.
THE REMAINDER OF THIS FILM WAS TAKEN SECRETLY AT ONE OF THESE MOUSE PARTIES BY A BBC CAMERAMAN POSING AS A VOLE.
AS USUAL, WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE POOR QUALITY OF THE FILM.
Mr.
"A": WELL, UH, THEN YOU STEAL SOME CHEESE BRIE OR CAMEMBER OR CHEDDAR OR GOUDA, IF YOU'RE ON THE HARDER STUFF.
YOU MIGHT GO AND SEE ONE OF THE BLUE CHEESE FILMS.
THEN THERE'S A BIG CLOCK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE ROOM AND ABOUT 12:50, YOU CLIMB UP IT AND THEN EVENTUALLY IT STRIKES ONE AND YOU ALL RUN DOWN.
Interviewer: WHAT'S THAT? Mr.
"A": THAT'S THE FARMER'S WIFE.
PERHAPS WE NEED TO KNOW MORE OF THESE MICE MEN BEFORE WE CAN REALLY JUDGE THEM.
PERHAPS NOT.
