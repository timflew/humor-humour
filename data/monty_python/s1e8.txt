NOW, I'VE NOTICED A TENDENCY FOR THIS PROGRAM TO GET RATHER SILLY.
NOW, I DO MY BES TO KEEP THINGS MOVING ALONG BUT I'M NOT HAVING THINGS GETTING SILLY.
THOSE LAST TWO SKETCHES I DID GOT VERY SILLY INDEED AND THAT LAST ONE ABOUT THE BED WAS EVEN SILLIER.
NOW, NOBODY LIKES A GOOD LAUGH MORE THAN I DO EXCEPT PERHAPS MY WIFE AND SOME OF HER FRIENDS.

GO ON, MOVE, MOVE! GO ON, GET OUT.
(others protesting) GO ON, GET OUT.

Man: MOVE, MOVE! (commotion) (laughter) (old recording of swing song begins playing) (door opens, shop bell tinkles) HELLO, I WISH TO REGISTER A COMPLAINT.
HELLO? MISS? WHAT DO YOU MEAN "MISS"? OH, I'M SORRY, I HAVE A COLD.
I WISH TO MAKE A COMPLAINT.
SORRY, WE'RE CLOSING FOR LUNCH.
NEVER MIND THAT, MY LAD I WISH TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS PARRO WHAT I PURCHASED NOT HALF AN HOUR AGO FROM THIS VERY BOUTIQUE.
OH, YES, THE NORWEGIAN BLUE.
WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT? I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.
IT'S DEAD, THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT.
NO, NO, IT'S RESTING, LOOK.
LOOK, MY LAD, I KNOW A DEAD PARROT WHEN I SEE ONE AND I'M LOOKING AT ONE RIGHT NOW.
NO, NO, SIR, IT'S NOT DEAD, IT'S RESTING.
RESTING? YEAH, REMARKABLE BIRD, THE NORWEGIAN BLUE BEAUTIFUL PLUMAGE, ISN'T IT? THE PLUMAGE DON'T ENTER INTO IT IT'S STONE DEAD.

THAT WAS YOU PUSHING THE CAGE.
I DID NOT! YES, YOU DID.
HELLO, POLLY! POLLY! POLLY PARROT, WAKE UP! POLLY! NOW, THAT'S WHAT I CALL A DEAD PARROT.
NO, NO, IT'S STUNNED.
LOOK, MY LAD, I'VE HAD JUST ABOU ENOUGH OF THIS.
THAT PARRO IS DEFINITELY DECEASED.
AND WHEN I BOUGHT I NOT HALF AN HOUR AGO YOU ASSURED ME THAT ITS LACK OF MOVEMEN WAS DUE TO IT BEING TIRED AND SHAGGED OUT AFTER A LONG SQUAWK.
WELL, SIR IT'S PROBABLY PINING FOR THE FJORDS.
"PINING FOR THE FJORDS"? WHAT KIND OF TALK IS THAT? LOOK, WHY DID IT FALL FLAT ON ITS BACK THE MOMENT I GOT IT HOME? THE NORWEGIAN BLUE PREFERS KIPPING ON ITS BACK.
IT'S A BEAUTIFUL BIRD, LOVELY PLUMAGE.
LOOK, I TOOK THE LIBERTY OF EXAMINING THAT PARRO AND I DISCOVERED THAT THE ONLY REASON THAT IT HAD BEEN SITTING ON ITS PERCH IN THE FIRST PLACE WAS THAT IT HAD BEEN NAILED THERE.
(loud laughter) WELL, OF COURSE IT WAS NAILED THERE.
OTHERWISE IT WOULD MUSCLE UP TO THOSE BARS AND VOOM! LOOK, MATEY THIS PARRO WOULDN'T VOOM IF I PUT 4,000 VOLTS THROUGH IT.
IT'S BLEEDING DEMISED.
IT'S NOT, IT'S PINING.
IT'S NOT PINING, IT'S PASSED ON.
THIS PARRO IS NO MORE.
IT HAS CEASED TO BE.
IT'S EXPIRED AND GONE TO MEET ITS MAKER.
THIS IS A LATE PARROT.
(laughter) IT'S A STIFF.
BEREFT OF LIFE, IT RESTS IN PEACE.
IF YOU HADN'T NAILED I TO THE PERCH IT WOULD BE PUSHING UP THE DAISIES.
IT'S RUNG DOWN THE CURTAIN AND JOINED THE CHOIR INVISIBLE.
THIS IS AN EX-PARROT.
(laughter) WELL, I'D BETTER REPLACE IT, THEN.
IF YOU WANT TO GE ANYTHING DONE IN THIS COUNTRY YOU'VE GOT TO COMPLAIN TILL YOU'RE BLUE IN THE MOUTH.
SORRY, GUV, WE'RE RIGHT OUT OF PARROTS.
I SEE, I SEE, I GET THE PICTURE.
I'VE GOT A SLUG.
(laughter) DOES IT TALK? NOT REALLY, NO.
WELL, IT'S SCARCELY A REPLACEMENT, THEN, IS IT? LISTEN, I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, TELL YOU WHA IF YOU GO TO MY BROTHER'S PET SHOP IN BOLTON HE'LL REPLACE YOUR PARROT FOR YOU.

(laughter) (bell tinkles, door closes) (man whistling) I WISH TO MAKE A COMPLAINT.
I DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS, YOU KNOW.

I ONLY DO THIS BECAUSE I LIKE BEING ME OWN BOSS.
UH, EXCUSE ME, THIS IS IRRELEVANT, ISN'T IT? OH, YEAH, IT'S NOT EASY TO PAD THESE OU TO 30 MINUTES.
WELL, I WISH TO MAKE A COMPLAINT.

(laughter) (shop bell tinkles) I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS BOLTON.
YEAH.
WELL, YOU TOLD ME IT WAS IPSWICH.
IT WAS A PUN.
(laughter) A PUN? NO, NO, NOT A PUN, NO.
WHAT'S THE OTHER THING WHICH READS THE SAME BACKWARDS AS FORWARDS? A PALINDROME? YEAH, YEAH.
IT'S NOT A PALINDROME.
THE PALINDROME OF BOLTON WOULD BE "NOTLOB.
" IT DON'T WORK.
LOOK, WHAT DO YOU WANT? NO, I'M SORRY.
I'M NOT PREPARED TO PURSUE MY LINE OF INQUIRY ANY FURTHER AS I THINK THIS IS GETTING TOO SILLY.
QUITE AGREE, QUITE AGREE.

Narrator: THIS IS A FRIGHTENED CITY.
OVER THESE HOUSES, OVER THESE STREETS HANGS A PALL OF FEAR FEAR OF A NEW KIND OF VIOLENCE WHICH IS TERRORIZING THE CITY.
YES, GANGS OF OLD LADIES ATTACKING DEFENSELESS, FIT YOUNG MEN.
(men groaning) TAKE THAT! (sinister music playing) Man: WELL, THEY COME UP TO YOU, LIKE, AND PUSH YOU, YOU KNOW SHOVE YOU OFF THE PAVEMENT, LIKE.
THERE'S USUALLY FOUR OR FIVE OF THEM.
Man 2: YEAH, THIS THIS USED TO BE A NICE NEIGHBORHOOD BEFORE THE OLD LADIES STARTED MOVING IN.
NOWADAYS SOME OF US DAREN' EVEN GO DOWN TO THE SHOPS.
WELL, MR.
JOHNSON'S SON KEVIN, HE DON'T GO OUT ANYMORE.
HE COMES BACK FROM WRESTLING AND LOCKS HIMSELF IN HIS ROOM.
(old ladies snickering) Narrator: WHAT ARE THEY IN IT FOR THESE OLD HOODLUMS, THESE LAYABOUTS IN LACE? Old lady: WELL, IT IT'S SOMETHING TO DO, ISN'T IT? Old lady 2: IT'S GOOD FUN.
Old lady 3: IT'S IT'S LIKE, UH YOU KNOW WELL, ISN'T IT, EH? Narrator: FAVORITE TARGETS FOR THE OLD LADIES ARE TELEPHONE KIOSKS.
(all snickering) (audience laughter) WELL, COME ON, COME ON, OFF WITH YOU.
CLEAR OUT, COME ON, GET OUT OF IT.
WE HAVE A LOT OF TROUBLE WITH THESE OLDIES.
PENSION DAY'S THE WORST THEY GO MAD.
AS SOON AS THEY GE THEIR HANDS ON THEIR MONEY THEY BLOW IT ALL ON MILK, BREAD, TEA, TIN OF MEAT FOR THE CAT.
WELL, YES, WELL, OF COURSE, COME THE 2:00 MATINEE ALL THE OLD BAGS ARE IN THERE ESPECIALLY IF IT'S SOMETHING LIKE THE SOUND OF MUSIC.
WE GET SEATS RIPPED UP, HEARING AIDS BROKEN ALL THAT SORT OF THING.
THE WHOLE PROBLEM OF THESE SENILE DELINQUENTS LIES IN THEIR COMPLETE REJECTION OF THE VALUES OF CONTEMPORARY SOCIETY.
THEY'VE SEEN THEIR CHILDREN GROW UP AND BECOME ACCOUNTANTS STOCKBROKERS AND EVEN SOCIOLOGISTS AND THEY BEGIN TO WONDER, IS IT ALL REALLY (narrator screaming while falling) (laughter) OH, WELL, WE SOMETIMES FEEL WE'RE TO BLAME IN SOME WAY FOR WHAT OUR GRAN'S BECOME.
I MEAN, SHE USED TO BE QUITE HAPPY HERE UNTIL SHE SHE STARTED ON THE CROCHET.
Interviewer: CROCHET? YEAH, NOW SHE CAN'T DO WITHOUT IT.
20 BALLS OF WOOL A DAY, SOMETIMES.
IF SHE CAN'T GET THE WOOL, SHE GETS VIOLENT.
WHAT CAN WE DO ABOUT IT? (engines revving) (laughter) Narrator: BUT THIS IS NO JUST AN OLD LADIES' TOWN.
THERE ARE OTHER EQUALLY DANGEROUS GANGS SUCH AS THE BABY SNATCHERS.
(babies bawling) I JUST LEFT MY HUSBAND OUTSIDE HERE WHILE I WENT IN TO DO SOME SHOPPING AND I CAME BACK AND HE WAS GONE.
HE WAS ONLY 47.
(sobbing) Narrator: AND ON THE ROADS, TOO, VICIOUS GANGS OF "KEEP LEFT" SIGNS.
RIGHT, RIGHT, STOP IT.
THIS FILM'S GOT SILLY.
STARTED OFF WITH A NICE LITTLE IDEA ABOUT GRANNIES ATTACKING YOUNG MEN BUT NOW IT'S GOT SILLY.
THIS MAN'S HAIR IS TOO LONG FOR A VICAR, TOO.
THESE SIGNS ARE PRETTY BADLY MADE.
RIGHT, NOW FOR A COMPLETE CHANGE OF MOOD.
I'VE HEARD OF UNISEX BUT I'VE NEVER HAD IT.
