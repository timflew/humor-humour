I HATE CUTTING HAIR.
I HAVE THIS TERRIBLE UN-UN-UN-UNCONTROLLABLE FEAR WHENEVER I SEE HAIR.
WHEN I WAS A KID I USED TO HATE THE SIGH OF HAIR BEING CUT.
MY MOTHER SAID I WAS A FOOL.
SHE SAID THE ONLY WAY TO CURE I WAS BECOME A BARBER.
SO I SPENT FIVE GHASTLY YEARS IN THE HAIRDRESSER'S TRAINING CENTER AT TOTNES.
CAN YOU IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE CUTTING THE SAME HEAD FOR FIVE YEARS!? I DIDN'T WANT TO BE A BARBER ANYWAY.
I WANTED TO BE A LUMBERJACK.
LEAPING FROM TREE TO TREE AS THEY FLOAT DOWN THE MIGHTY RIVERS OF BRITISH COLUMBIA.
THE GIANT REDWOOD, THE LARCH, THE FIR, THE MIGHTY SCOTS PINE.
THE SMELL OF FRESH-CUT TIMBER! THE CRASH OF MIGHTY TREES! WITH MY BEST GIRLIE BY MY SIDE.

"DEAR SIR, I WISH TO COMPLAIN IN THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE TERMS "ABOUT THE SONG WHICH YOU HAVE JUST BROADCAS "ABOUT THE LUMBERJACK WHO WEARS WOMEN'S CLOTHES.
