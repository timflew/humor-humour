ALAKAZAM! ALACADABRA! ALAKAZAM! ALACADABRA! ALAKAZAM! ALACADABRA! ALAKAZAM! ALACADABRA HELLO! TONIGHT, SPECTRUM LOOKS AT ONE OF THE MAJOR PROBLEMS IN THE WORLD TODAY THE WHOLE VEXED QUESTION OF WHAT IS GOING ON.
IS THERE STILL TIME TO CONFRONT I LET ALONE SOLVE IT, OR IS IT TOO LATE? WHAT ARE THE FIGURES, WHAT ARE THE FACTS? WHAT DO PEOPLE MEAN WHEN THEY TALK ABOUT THINGS? ALEXANDER HARDACRE OF THE ECONOMIC AFFAIRS BUREAU.
IN THIS GRAPH THIS COLUMN REPRESENTS 23% OF THE POPULATION.
THIS COLUMN REPRESENTS 28% OF THE POPULATION AND THIS COLUMN REPRESENTS 43% OF THE POPULATION.
TELLING FIGURES INDEED, BUT WHAT DO THEY MEAN TO YOU? WHAT DO THEY MEAN TO ME? WHAT DO THEY MEAN TO THE AVERAGE MAN IN THE STREET? WITH ME NOW IS PROFESSOR TIDDLES OF LEEDS UNIVERSITY.
PROFESSOR, YOU'VE SPENT MANY YEARS RESEARCHING INTO THINGS.
WHAT DO YOU THINK? I THINK IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL.
TOO EARLY TO TELL, TOO EARLY TO SAY.
IT MEANS THE SAME THING.
THE WORD "SAY" IS THE SAME AS THE WORD "TELL.
" THEY'RE NOT SPELLED THE SAME, BUT THEY MEAN THE SAME.
IT'S AN IDENTICAL SITUATION WE HAVE WITH "SHIP" AND "BOAT" BUT NOT THE SAME AS WE HAVE WITH "BOW" AND "BOUGH" DIFFERENT SPELLINGS AND MEANINGS, BUT SOUND THE SAME.
WHAT IS THE SOLUTION, IF ANY, TO THIS PROBLEM? WHAT CAN WE DO? WHAT AM I SAYING? WHY AM I SITTING IN THIS CHAIR? WHY AM I HERE AND WHAT WILL I SAY NEXT? HERE TO ANSWER THIS IS A PROFESSIONAL CRICKETER.
I CAN SAY NOTHING AT THIS POINT.

AND THEY'RE BLAZING AWAY THERE.
THEY'RE NOT GETTING QUITE THE RESULTS THAT THEY MIGHT.
