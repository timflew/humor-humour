MR.
JACKSON.
GOOD EVENING.
MAY I JUST SIDETRACK YOU FOR ONE MOMENT, MR.
JACKSON? THIS-- WHAT SHALL I CALL IT?--|NICKNAME OF YOURS OH, YES.
TWO SHEDS.
HOW DID YOU COME BY IT? WELL, I DON'T|USE IT MYSELF.
IT'S JUST A FEW OF MY|FRIENDS CALL ME "TWO SHEDS.
" I SEE.
AND DO YOU IN FACT|HAVE TWO SHEDS? NO, I'VE ONLY|ONE SHED.
I'VE HAD ONE|FOR SOME TIME.
BUT A FEW YEARS AGO|I SAID I WAS THINKING OF GETTING ANOTHER ONE,|AND SINCE THEN SOME PEOPLE HAVE|CALLED ME "TWO SHEDS.
" IN SPITE OF THE FACT|THAT YOU HAVE ONLY ONE.
YES.
I SEE AND|ARE YOU THINKING OF PURCHASING|A SECOND SHED? NO.
TO BRING YOU IN LINE|WITH YOUR EPITHET? NO.
I SEE, I SEE.
WELL, LET'S RETURN|TO YOUR SYMPHONY.
DID YOU WRITE THIS SYMPHONY IN THE SHED? NO.
HAVE YOU WRITTEN ANY OF YOUR RECENT WORKS|IN THIS SHED OF YOURS? NO, IT'S JUST A PERFECTLY|ORDINARY GARDEN SHED.
I SEE.
AND YOU'RE THINKING OF|BUYING THIS SECOND SHED TO WRITE IN? NO, NO, LOOK|THIS SHED BUSINESS IT DOESN'T REALLY|MATTER AT ALL.
THE SHEDS AREN'T|IMPORTANT.
IT'S JUST A FEW FRIENDS|CALL ME "TWO SHEDS" AND THAT'S ALL|THERE IS TO IT.
I WISH YOU'D ASK ME|ABOUT ME MUSIC.
I'M A COMPOSER.
PEOPLE ALWAYS ASK ME|ABOUT THE SHEDS.
THEY'VE GOT IT|OUT OF PROPORTION.
I'M FED UP|WITH THE SHEDS.
I WISH I'D NEVER GOT IT|IN THE FIRST PLACE.
I EXPECT YOU'RE PROBABLY|THINKING OF SELLING ONE.
I WILL SELL ONE.
THEN YOU'D BE ARTHUR|"NO SHEDS" JACKSON.
LOOK, FORGET ABOUT THE SHEDS--|THEY DON'T MATTER.
MR.
JACKSON, I THINK,|WITH RESPECT WE OUGHT TO TALK|ABOUT YOUR SYMPHONY.
WHAT? APPARENTLY YOUR|SYMPHONY WAS WRITTEN FOR ORGAN AND TIMPANI.
WHAT'S THAT? WHAT'S WHAT? IT'S A SHED--|GET IT OFF.
ALL RIGHT.
NOW, THEN,|MR.
JACKSON YOUR SYMPHONY.
I UNDERSTAND|THAT YOU USED THAT YOU USED|TO BE INTERESTED|IN TRAINSPOTTING.
WHAT? I UNDERSTAND THAT ABOUT 30 YEARS AGO YOU WERE EXTREMELY INTERESTED|IN TRAINSPOTTING.
WHAT'S THAT GOT TO DO|WITH MY BLOODY MUSIC?? ARE YOU HAVING ANY TROUBLE FROM HIM? YES, A LITTLE.
WELL, WE INTERVIEWERS|ARE MORE THAN A MATCH FOR THE LIKES|OF YOU, TWO SHEDS.
YES, MAKE YOURSELF|SCARCE, TWO SHEDS.
THIS STUDIO|ISN'T BIG ENOUGH FOR THE THREE OF US.
GET YOUR OWN ARTS|PROGRAM, YOU FAIRY.
ARTHUR "TWO SHEDS"|JACKSON.
Interviewer 1:|NEVER MIND, TIMMY.
Interviewer 2:|OH, MICHAEL, YOU'RE|SUCH A COMFORT.
ARTHUR "TWO SHEDS" JACKSON.
AND NOW FOR MORE NEWS OF|THE MOMENTOUS ARTISTIC EVENT WHEN PABLO PICASSO IS DOING A SPECIALLY COMMISSIONED|PAINTING FOR US WHILST RIDING A BICYCLE.
PABLO PICASSO,|THE FOUNDER OF MODERN ART WITHOUT DOUBT THE GREATEST|ABSTRACT PAINTER EVER FOR THE FIRST TIME|PAINTING IN MOTION.
BUT FIRST OF ALL LET'S HAVE A LOOK|AT THE ROUTE HE'LL BE TAKING.
WELL, PICASSO WILL BE STARTING,|DAVID, AT CHICHESTER HERE.
HE'LL THEN CYCLE|ON THE A29 TO FONTWELL.
HE'LL THEN TAKE THE A272, WHICH|WILL BRING HIM ON TO THE A3 JUST NORTH OF HINDHEAD HERE.
FROM THEN ON, PABLO HAS|A STRAIGHT RUN ON THE A3 UNTIL HE MEETS THE SOUTH|CIRCULAR AT BATTERSEA HERE.
WELL, THIS IS A TRULY|REMARKABLE OCCASION.
IT'S THE FIRST TIME THAT A MODERN ARTIST OF SUCH|STATURE HAS TAKEN THE A272.
AND IT'LL BE VERY|INTERESTING TO SEE HOW HE COPES|WITH THE HEAVY TRAFFIC ROUND THE WISBOROUGH|GREEN-- VICKY.
WELL, PICASSO WILL BE RIDING|HIS VIKING SUPER ROADSTER WITH THE DROP HANDLEBARS|AND THE DUAL-THREAD WHEEL RIMS.
AND WITH HIS WILEY-PRAT|20-TO-1 SYNCHRO-MESH HE SHOULD EXPERIENCE|DIFFICULTIES ON THE SORT OF ROAD SURFACES THEY JUST DON'T|GET ABROAD-- MITZIE.
AND NOW FOR THE LATEST REPORT|ON PICASSO'S PROGRESS OVER TO REG MOSS|ON THE GUILDFORD BYPASS.
WELL, THERE'S NO SIGN|OF PICASSO AT THE MOMENT, DAVID BUT HE SHOULD BE|THROUGH HERE AT ANY MOMENT.
HOWEVER, I DO HAVE WITH ME MR.
RON GEPPO,|BRITISH CYCLING SPRINT CHAMPION AND THIS|YEAR'S WINNER OF THE DERBY|DONCASTER RALLY.
WELL, REG, I THINK|PABLO SHOULD BE ALL RIGHT PROVIDED HE DOESN'T|ATTEMPT ANYTHING ON THE MONUMENTAL SCALE OF SOME OF HIS|EARLIER PAINTINGS LIKE GUERNICA OR|MADEMOISELLES D'A VIGNON OR EVEN HIS LATER|WAR AND PEACE MURALS FOR THE TEMPLE OF PEACE|CHAPEL AT VALLAURIS BECAUSE WITH THIS STRONG HEAD|WIND, I DON'T THINK EVEN DOUG TIMPSON|OF MANCHESTER HARRIERS COULD PAINT ANYTHING|ON THAT KIND OF SCALE.
WELL, THANK|YOU, RON.
WELL, THERE STILL|SEEMS TO BE NO|SIGN OF PICASSO SO I'LL HAND YOU|BACK TO THE STUDIO.
WELL, WE'VE JUST HEARD THAT PICASSO IS APPROACHING THE|TOLWORTH ROUNDABOUT ON THE A3.
SO COME IN,|SAM TRENCH AT TOLWORTH.
WELL, SOMETHING CERTAINLY|IS HAPPENING HERE AT TOLWORTH ROUNDABOUT, DAVID.
I CAN NOW SEE PICASSO.
HE'S CYCLING DOWN VERY HARD TOWARDS THE ROUNDABOUT.
HE'S ABOUT 75, 50 YARDS AWAY AND I CAN NOW SEE HIS PAINTING.
IT'S AN ABSTRACT.
I CAN SEE SOME BLUE, SOME PURPLE SOME LITTLE BLACK OVAL SHAPES.
I THINK I CAN SEE THAT'S NOT PICASSO.
THAT'S KANDINSKY.
GOOD LORD,|YOU'RE RIGHT! IT'S KANDINSKY,|WASILY KANDINSKY! AND WHO'S THIS|HERE WITH HIM? IT'S BRAQUE,|GEORGES BRAQUE|OF THE CUBISTS PAINTING A BIRD|IN FLIGHT OVER|A CORNFIELD AND GOING VERY FAST|DOWN THE HILL TOWARDS KINGSTON.
AND PIET MONDRIAN|JUST BEHIND PIET MONDRIAN|THE NEOPLASTICIST THEN A GAP,|THEN THE MAIN BUNCH.
HERE THEY COME: CHAGALL,|MAX ERNST, MIRO, DUFY BEN NICHOLSON,|JACKSON POLLOCK AND BERNARD BUFFET|MAKING A BREAK ON THE OUTSIDE HERE.
BRANCUSI'S|GOING WITH HIM.
SO IS GERICAULT,|FERNAND LEGER, DELAUNAY DE KOONING KOKOSCHKA'S|DROPPING BACK HERE BY A LITTLE BIT AND SO'S PAUL KLEE|DROPPING BACK A BIT AND, RIGHT AT THE BACK|OF THIS GROUP OUR VERY OWN|KURT SCHWITTERS.
SCHWITTERS|IS GERMAN.
AS YET ABSOLUTELY|NO SIGN OF|PABLO PICASSO.
AND SO, FROM|TOLWORTH ROUNDABOUT BACK TO THE STUDIO.
( laughter ) WELL, I THINK I CAN|HELP YOU THERE, SAM.
WE'RE GETTING REPORTS IN|FROM THE A.
A.
THAT PICASSO PICASSO HAS FALLEN OFF! HE'S FALLEN OFF HIS BICYCLE ON|THE B2127 JUST OUTSIDE EWHURST TRYING TO GET A SHORTCUT|THROUGH TO DORKING VIA GOMSLAKE AND PEASHALL.
WELL, PICASSO IS|REPORTED TO BE UNHURT BUT THE PIG HAS|A SLIGHT HEADACHE.
AND ON THAT NOTE, WE|MUST SAY GOOD NIGHT TO YOU.
PICASSO HAS FAILED IN HIS FIRST BID FOR|INTERNATIONAL CYCLING FAME.
SO FROM ALL OF US HERE|AT THE IT'S THEARTS STUDIO IT'S GOOD NIGHT.
|GOOD NIGHT.
( grunts, squeals ) ( military march plays ) Man:|HOLD IT.

PORKER, EH? SWINE.
Narrator:|THIS MAN IS ERNEST SCRIBBLER,|WRITER OF JOKES.
IN A FEW MOMENTS HE WILL HAVE WRITTEN THE|FUNNIEST JOKE IN THE WORLD AND, AS A CONSEQUENCE,|HE WILL DIE LAUGHING.
( giggles ) ( chortles ) ( laughing ) ( audience laughing ) Narrator:|IT WAS OBVIOUS|THAT THIS JOKE WAS LETHAL.
NO ONE COULD READ IT AND LIVE.
( gasping ) ( tittering ) ( shrieking with laughter ) THIS MORNING,|SHORTLY AFTER 11:00 COMEDY STRUCK THIS LITTLE|HOUSE IN DIBLEY ROAD.
SUDDEN, VIOLENT COMEDY.
POLICE HAVE SEALED OFF THE AREA AND SCOTLAND YARD'S CRACK|INSPECTOR IS WITH ME NOW.
I SHALL ENTER|THE HOUSE AND ATTEMPT TO|REMOVE THE JOKE.
( screaming laughter ) ( grunt ) I SHALL BE AIDED BY THE SOUND|OF SOMBER MUSIC PLAYED ON|GRAMOPHONE RECORDS AND ALSO BY THE|CHANTING OF LAMENTS BY THE MEN OF|"Q" DIVISION.
THE ATMOSPHERE THUS CREATED|SHOULD PROTECT ME IN THE EVENTUALITY|OF ME READING THE JOKE.
( moaning ) ( somber orchestral|musicplays ) WELL, THERE GOES A BRAVE MAN.
WHETHER HE COMES|OUT ALIVE OR NOT THIS WILL SURELY BE REMEMBERED AS ONE OF THE MOST COURAGEOUS|AND GALLANT ACTS IN POLICE HISTORY.
( cackling ) ( cackling, moaning stop ) Narrator:|IT WAS NOT LONG BEFORE THE ARMY|BECAME INTERESTED IN THE MILITARY POTENTIAL|OF THE KILLER JOKE.
UNDER TOP SECURITY,|THE JOKE WAS HURRIED TO A MEETING|OF ALLIED COMMANDERS AT THE MINISTRY OF WAR.

TESTS ON SALISBURY PLAIN|CONFIRMED THE JOKE'S DEVASTATING|EFFECTIVENESS AT A RANGE OF UP TO 50 YARDS.
( snickers ) ( audience laughing ) ( in unison ):|FANTASTIC.
ALL THROUGH THE WINTER OF '43 WE HAD TRANSLATORS WORKING|IN JOKE-PROOF CONDITIONS TO TRY AND PRODUCE A GERMAN|VERSION OF THE JOKE.
THEY WORKED ON ONE WORD EACH|FOR GREATER SAFETY.
ONE OF THEM SAW|TWO WORDS OF THE JOKE AND SPENT SEVERAL|WEEKS IN HOSPITAL.
BUT APART FROM THAT,|THINGS WENT PRETTY QUICKLY AND WE SOON HAD|THE JOKE BY JANUARY IN A FORM WHICH OUR TROOPS|COULDN'T UNDERSTAND BUT WHICH THE GERMANS COULD.
( explosions ) ( gunfire ) Narrator:|SO ON JULY 8, 1944 THE JOKE WAS FIRST TOLD|TO THE ENEMY IN THE ARDENNES.
( gunfire ) SQUAD, GET|READY JOKE! SQUAD, TELL|THE JOKE! ALL:|WENN IST DAS NUNSTUCK|GEHT UND SLOTERMEYER? JA! BA YERHUND DAS ODER|DIE FLIPPERWALDT GESPUHRT! ( weapons fall silent ) ( men muttering in German ) ( roaring laughter ) Narrator:|IT WAS A FANTASTIC SUCCESS OVER 60,000 TIMES AS POWERFUL|AS BRITAIN'S GREAT PREWAR JOKE AND ONE WHICH HITLER|JUST COULDN'T MATCH.
INSBESONDERE KEINER MEHR DER|IN DEUTSCHLAND LEBEN WIRD WIR SIND DES REICHES|JUNGE MANNSCHAFT! EURE SCHULE.

( laughing ) Man ( in German accent ):|WHAT IS THE BIG JOKE? I CAN ONLY GIVE|YOU A NAME, RANK AND "WHY DID THE CHICKEN|CROSS THE ROAD?" THAT'S NOT FUNNY.
( moans ) I WANT TO KNOW THE JOKE! ALL RIGHT.
HOW DO YOU MAKE|A NAZI CROSS? I DON'T KNOW.
HOW DO YOU MAKE|A NAZI CROSS? TREAD ON HIS CORNS.
GOTT IM HIMMEL! THAT'S NOT FUNNY! NOW, IF YOU DON'T|TELL ME THE JOKE I SHALL HIT|YOU PROPERLY.
I CAN STAND PHYSICAL|PAIN, YOU KNOW.
ACH, YOU'RE NO FUN! ALL RIGHT, OTTO! OH, NO-- NO, ANYTHING|BUT THAT, PLEASE.
TICKLE HIM.
( laughing ) ALL RIGHT, I'LL TELL YOU.

BA YERHUND DAS ODER|DIE FLIPPERWALDT GESPUHRT! HMM? ( snickers ) Narrator:|IN PEENEMUNDE|IN THE AUTUMN OF '44 THE GERMANS WERE WORKING|ON A JOKE OF THEIR OWN.

"NEIN, "ZWECKT DER HERREN.
"ISTAUF'N BORGER|MITZWEITINGEN.
" WE'LL LET|YOU KNOW.
Narrator:|BUT BY DECEMBER,|THEIR JOKE WAS READY.
AND HITLER GAVE THE ORDER Man ( over radio ):|There were zwei peanuts|waLking down the strasse and one was assaulted peanut.
( chortles ) ( "DeutschLand Uber ALLes"|playing ) IN 1945, PEACE BROKE OUT.
IT WAS THE END OF THE JOKE.
JOKE WARFARE WAS BANNED AT A SPECIAL SESSION OF THE|GENEVA CONVENTION, AND IN 1950 THE LAST REMAINING COPY|OF THE JOKE WAS LAID TO REST HERE IN THE BERKSHIRE|COUNTRYSIDE NEVER TO BE TOLD AGAIN.
