Subject matter.
Right.
What do you want to know? Do you mind if I talk to your staff later? - Why? I thought I'd have a chat to some of them.
OK.
Would you like to tell me about your individual outlook on management? Put 'Brent is refreshingly laid-back for a man with such responsibility.
' Just answer in your own words and I'll work that out.
Um 'Brent mused and then replied ' Are you getting it down? I'm going to be pretty Your question was 'Is it difficult to remain authoritative and yet so popular?' No, it wasn't.
I'll answer that first - Can we stick to my questions? Well, maybe you should be clear what the question is.
I was just um I was just talking to Emma about What is that pub we went to on Friday? Gareth Keenan, hello.

Just to flesh out David Brent the man.
Is there a better half? 'David quipped, 'Why buy a book when you can join a library?'' So you play the field? - Well I don't use chicks and shit.
I'm just chilling out while I'm young.
Are you in a relationship at the moment? So you don't have a girlfriend? - Well, what is a 'girlfriend'? Someone you'd have sex with? - Don't get coarse in a public magazine.

He comes in his pants.
Do it again.
I don't give myself a hard time about things.
I'm 30 years young now.
I'm not someone who has specific goals about doing this or that by my age.
'Why haven't I taken that chance?' If you look at life like rolling a dice, then my situation now may only be a three.
If I jack that in now, go for something better, I could easily roll a six.
No problem.
I could roll a six.
I could also roll a one.
So I think sometimes just leave the dice alone.
That's why my professionalism is only as important as Come in my humanism.
Hi.
I just wondered if you've got time for a chat.
I've always got time for staff, Dawn.
'He's always got time for staff.

' Shoot.
Before you leave, I wanted to hand in my notice.
Ooh, no.
Thought this would happen.
Who else is thinking of doing this? - No one.
Don't throw your career away because I'm leaving.
I know it won't be the same.
That's not why I'm going.
Reading between the lines.
- You haven't read it.
Is it just a coincidence you're handing in your notice when I'm leaving? Yes, it is.

We wondered if you'd do us a favour in the meantime and be caretaker manager.
Blimey.
God - Just doing David's job Obviously there'd be acting-up pay.
That's really flattering.
Thank you.
Listen, I'm going to say no and It's a bit more work for a lot more money.

It's only temporary.

Cheers.
People can't believe I'm this happy to be leaving.
Not because there's anything wrong with it, but you know I did that thing at the centre? Well, as I was giving that motivational speech, I could literally see them all getting all motivated from it.
It's like being born again.
It showed me how much I had to offer other people.
These are the guys from Cooper & Webb, the management training consultants.
This is Ray.
This is Jude.
This is Helena.
She's writing quite a big article on me for 'Inside Paper', the trade magazine.
I've mentioned our thing, so You don't mind if she sits in? Not if you don't.

Bye, Dawn.
Probably wondering who they're going to offer David's job too.
Me.
You got it? - Yes.
Congratulations.
- Thank you.
You can start bucking your ideas up.
Starting with your appearance.
What sort of management training is it? - We I'll answer.
They use celebrity speakers expert speakers.
And my personal tip is my rise to the top, which gives it a whole new edge.
So OK.
So where are we? Shoot.
We'd like to thank you for your time - No sweat.
But we won't be using you again.
- You won't be? Why not? - It's not what we were looking for.
How do you want me to do it? We have a very specific idea of what we're looking for Go on, then.
Timewasters.
- We're sorry Oh, get out.
Go on.
Thank you.
Wasting my time.
Me as well? - Yeah.
Would you mind if I took a quick photo? - No.
I'm waiting for the flash - Yeah.
There's a green light.
OK.
Right.
- Can I take one more for safety? Right.
- Thank you.
Hello.
- Hi.
All right? - Fine.
Am I fine? Um I've just heard you were leaving.
Blimey.
- Say it isn't so.
Word gets around fast.
- It's true? Yeah.
- Were you going to tell me? God, yeah.
- You were? Yes.
- OK.
Are you going to another job? No.
Lee and I are going to go away.
- On holiday? No.
We're going to Florida for about six months.
Something like that.
Six months? - Mm.
Lee's sister lives out there, so we could live with her.
He's not happy in his job.
I'm not happy in mine.
Is there a name for this? - I don't know.
Starting again? Right.

Cool.
Oh, God.
Hello.
The adventurer.
She's just telling me about the American thing.
Yeah.
Me sister's over there.
Got a big house.
We haven't seen it yet.
- Seen pictures.
Her husband's raking it in as well.
Yeah.
We thought we'd get a mobile home, drive up the coast till the cash runs out.
Then come home or get a place out there.
Accommodation's well cheap.
- Is it? If Dawn gets a job on reception, she'll be twice as well off.
That'd be nice, wouldn't it? Good luck.
I'd better get back to it.
Cheers, mate.
Hi, love.
How you doing? - Good.
You looking for swimming costumes? Bikinis? If you think every time you see each other you're going to glow or every time you hold hands there'll be electricity, you're kidding yourself.
What about reliability, paying the mortgage or someone who's never been out of work? Those are the more important practical things in reality.
She was having trouble with Lee at the time and it wasn't like a Under different circumstances, something might have happened.
She's going away now.
You can't change circumstances.
Sorry.
Excuse me.
Dawn, can I have a word in here? Ta.
She said no, by the way.
You all right, David? - Fine.
You? Yup.
- Good.
Small talk done.
Thanks very much.
Everyone really appreciates what you've done.
Yeah? OK.
Down to business.
That's what we've come up with as a redundancy offer.
Yup.
More than I expected.
- We've been quite generous.
Bada-bing.
You can leave on the third with your holiday, I understand, which is a Tuesday.
Did you want to come back for a party on the Friday or leave on the Friday before? Whatever.
OK.
Well, again, thanks very much, David.
Don't make me redundant.
Please.
- Look, David I don't want redundancy.
I haven't signed anything.
So David, unfortunately, it's not up to you.
All right, then.
Well, I'm asking.
OK? Please don't make me redundant.
You can talk to someone, Jenny.
The wheels are already in motion.
- Stop them.
We're not going to discuss this now.
- Say it's not definite before you go.
I will try twice as hard.
I know I've been complacent.
I'll turn this place around if you say it's not definite now and then we can You're not going until Starting from now.
You never know what's round the corner.
But it's all good.
If you want the rainbow, you've got to put up with the rain.
Do you know which 'philosopher' said that? Dolly Parton.
And people say she's just a pair of tits.
Hello.
Wernham-Hogg.
