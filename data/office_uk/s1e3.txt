- Oh, yeah? To be honest, I think you're mad to let me and Finchy on the bleedin' telly We're like Morecambe and Wise when we get together.
Not Morecambe and Wise, because there's no straight man, there's no dead wood.
So, um I'm more sort of character based, and he's more of a gag man.
I do gags as well I mean, good together by now.
We sort of read each other's minds when we're doing a bit of stick.
We're just cracking up, and people watching go, 'Why is that funny?' We tell them why and they go, 'Yeah.
You are the best' It's their opinion.
Happy birthday, by the way.
- Thank you.
Which one is it? - it's 30.
The big 3-0.
That's the worst one, isn't it? I know what you're thinking - 'My youth's over.
' When I was 30, like you, I was going, 'I'm in a rubbish job, nothing good ever happens to me.
When will it change?' But, you know Things do change.
- Mmm.
And it could be worse.

m.
- by the nurses.
He was convinced there was a Japanese sniper on the roof of Debenhams.
Does that look into his room? The back of the roof looks into his room, yeah.
Good spot.
It's a good spot, that's where I'd be if I had to take someone out that lived there.
And I had to go up to the room with him, and go, 'Look, Dad, there's no Japanese sniper' Who was up there? - no one was there.
it was his imagination.
There was no one there.
Lucky.
That's lucky.
if there was a sniper, you wouldn't see him.
You'd be like, 'Oh oh no one there.
' Anyway, he is a vegetable now.
And that's something we've all got to look forward to.
Happy birthday.
See you later.

Remember, you're only as old as the woman you feel.
I say that sometimes.
- I heard that the other day.
I thought 'He's using one of my catchphrases' I don't mind influencing a young comedian - you're not a comedian - but I usually credit someone if I use their comedy.
What ones of yours do I use? - Same shit, different day.
That's mine.
Ex-squeeze me, instead of excuse me.
Oh, wank you very much.
- Yeah.
I invented that one.
Say that to a waiter or something.
Wank you very much! And here's one.
Witnesses that I started this one.
If someone's unlucky, you go, 'I'm not saying he's unlucky, but if he fell in a barrelfull of tits, he'd come up sucking his own thumb!' Suck tits? I thought you sucked knobs.
Do ya? Got you! They're cracking up.
Oh, God Yeah.
There are limits to my comedy.
.
There are things I would never laugh at.
Um The handicapped because there's nothing funny about them.
Or any deformity.
Yeah? Um It's like when you see someone look at a little handicapped and go, 'Oh, look at him.
He's not able-bodied.
I am.
I'm prejudiced.
' Yeah? Well, at least the little handicapped fella is able-minded.
Unless he's not.
It's difficult to tell with the wheelchair ones.
So just give generously to all of them.

Hang on.

no, because i'd be ready for them.
You'd be lying there waiting for it?.
Yeah.
Well, no.
it's more likely that i wouldn't be there if i knew thay knew where i was.

His first major work was 'notes from the Underground,' which he wrote in St Petersburg in 1859.
Really?.
