I don't need anything like that.
I do my own training.
Sorry.
No We're not trying to get your business.

- Is it yours? No! - No.
I don't know Sorry.
This is an example of problems.
Let's have a look.
She says it's not hers and I believe her, so whose is it? Right.

What would your motto be? Some bosses are intimidated by training their staff up too well.
I don't mind it.
I actually like my staff to be better than me.
That keeps me on my toes.
So my motto would be Be careful because there's always somebody ready to step into your shoes and do your job better than you do it.
Heh heh.
I'm gluing the phone.
In the name of fun.

What's in it? - What's this? It's a little birthday bash for Trudy.

What are we talking about? - We want to involve this chap.
You could have asked me.

- We'd use both of you I can do both.

I'm a heck of a catch.
I mean, I live in Slough, in a lovely house with my parents.
I have my own room, which I've had since I was born.
That's seen a lot of action.
Mainly dusting.
I went to university for a year before I dropped out, so I'm a quitter.
So, yeah, form an orderly queue, ladies.

I've got five sets.
Don't try to beat me at Monster Trucks though.
It's a game of chance.
- It's not.
I'd know which cards you'd got by what I'd got.
I used to play it by myself with a dummy hand, testing out which cards beat which other cards, for hours sometimes.
Three or four hours at a time, but the rewards are obvious.
I know exactly which cards you've got from what I've got, so I would know exactly what feature to pick on my card to defeat any card that you could have in your hand.
You will never win.
It'd still be fun, though.
Do you know what they're paying me? - No.
Right.
15 minutes work, 300 quid.
1,200 an hour - You do the math.
Yeah.
It'd be 1,200 an hour.

Like you know! - Why are you laughing? I'm a dark horse.
Like you could get anyone like the Corrs! - Just 'cause I don't kiss and tell You don't kiss, there's nothing to tell.
- He'd end up with the brother! No.
I'd push the brother out of the room, bend them all over, do the drummer, the lead singer, and that one who plays violin.
See? Your fault.
Putting filth in people's minds.
My knees hurt.
- Nearly done.
