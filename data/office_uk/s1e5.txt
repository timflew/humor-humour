Welcome to Wernham Hogg Health and Safety Training with Gareth Keenan.
OK? That's me.
Pleased to meet you.
There are many hidden dangers in the workspace and we're going to find out what those dangers are together.
Starting off with your workstation.
Now, I want you to imagine that this is a mug of hot coffee.
It's not, because that would be dangerous even in training.
What we're going to do is play a little fun game that I've made up.
I like to have a bit of fun when I'm teaching people.
I like a laugh most of the time - in and out of work.
Some us are going out tonight - Shall we crack on? Good.
Keen.
Excellent.
All right.
Now watch where I place this mug in order to simulate where someone might put a mug in real life.
What I want you to do is shout out - shout, mind - 'safe' or 'dangerous.
' Think you could manage that? OK.
Let's go.
Dangerous.
Dangerous.
What have we learnt? - Don't pour coffee on the computer.
Any fluids.
Right? Good.
First-class, please.
Are you all right? - Eh? Are you all right? - Yeah.
Fine, thanks.
Have you had a good morning or a bad morning? A bit of a Oh, God, a bit of a mad morning.
Never mind.
- See you later.
OK.
Basically, there's a correct way and an incorrect way to lift stuff.
This is the incorrect way.
OK? Incorrect.
The correct way.
Two things to remember.
Keep your back nice and straight.
Straight back.
And bend your knees.
Keep your back straight and bend your knees.
Right? Very important.
Do you want to try that with me? I'm fine.
I'm supposed to witness you do it so I can tick the box.
Just do it with me a couple of times.
Right.
So nice straight back, bend your knees Up.
That's it.
Same on the way down as on the way up.
Down again.
Good.
One more time.
Nice straight back.
That's it.
That's it.
Great.
One more time.
So have you got that? I'll practise it at home.
Excellent.
Good.
Well done.
If you have any questions or if you want to talk about anything at all I know you've um You slept with Jeff.
- Are we done? You made a mistake - I haven't.
I'm just checking whether you're going to be spreading it around Right.
Bye.
Good.
Yeah.
Excellent pupil.
Fast learner.
She won't be spilling any fluids or lifting things incorrectly.
'A' I'm going to give her.
'A.
' Quick question.
I've got these invoices to file and I don't know Yes? - Where do I file these? I don't know.
- Excellent.
Thanks.
It's not as if she's your daughter, But that's not the point.
It's the principle.
It was about respect.
Showing a bit of respect.
And while she's under my roof, she will obey my laws.
So Show them respect by being the law.
She's legal though.
When cherries are red, they're ready for plucking, when girls are 16, they're - Gareth.
You heard that one.
- Well Are you going to fire the person she shag slept with? It's a free country.
I can't do anything about it.
So you won't fire them, as such? I won't look on him favourably.
- Or her.
It could be a girl.
She's not a lesbian, Gareth.
I think I'd know if a woman living under my roof liked to roll around with other women.
Gareth? Don't you? Yup.
Most probably.
Spoke to you at five, get the call at six from the lads, drinks at eight in the Chasers.
Spare bird going.
- Not for long! So I get there, she's aged 19.
Ferrari chassis, fantastic-sized shelves, and legs up to her arse.
Muchos tequilas later, I'm in a cab with her.
And my mate's bird wants to get a lift with me and this nympho.
Finchy! - There I am, back of the cab, both of them with their laughing gear round the pump-action rifle.
Got back to mine, two hours sleep, yeah? Today, I bump into the mate whose bird I've done sold him two ton of high white.
He says to me, 'You look knackered.
' And he looks like he's had a Pot Noodle and a wank.
I'd have said that to him.
I shit you not.
I'm seeing both of them tomorrow night.
Coming out tonight though? - Definitely.
Are you coming, jobless? Yeah.
If only for the conversation.
Pot Noodle and a wank! I don't know where we're going tonl'ght, Obviously, Finchy's a sophisticated guy, and Gareth's a culture vulture, Will it be opera, ballet? I don't know.
I know the RSC's in town, so Having said that, at Chasers, it's a Hooch for a pound and Wonderbras get in free night, so I don't know.
It's exciting.
I'm staying out of it.
'OUT OF YOUR MIND' BY THE TRUESTEPPERS) Garcon! Who wants a Finch pinch? - What? Chris Finch, good to meet you.
This is my friend Sir David Brent.
Joking.
The only knighthood he's got's a condom.
Night-hood.
Condom.
- I'm saying the joke worked.
Condoms come in all different flavours now, don't they? Like strawberry and curry and that.
Do you like curry? What are your names? I'm Lorna.
This is Lindsey and Heather.
Pleased to meet you.
Nice to meet you.
And very nice to meet you.
Nice to meet all of you.
Anyone's fine.

While you're down there, love.
You know what they say - one up the bum, no harm done.
You not heard that before? - Yeah.
Christ, that'll do.
If you're looking for a seat, you can sit on my face! Not her.
She's staying with me.
Her dad'll kill me.
Leave it.
- You lucky bastard.
Hey, do you want something hard? Don't.
Do it to other girls.
Please, just We go there every Wednesday nl'ght, It's a fun place, but it's full of loose women.
And my only problem with that is venereal disease, which is disabilitating.
Especially for a soldier.
And it's irresponsible to your unit.
You've been under attack for days, there's a soldier down, he's wounded, gangrene's setting in.
'Who's used all the penicillin?' 'Mark Paxton, sir.
He's got knob rot off some tart.
' Coming through.
R- aargh! Don't worry.
I haven't got any balls.
Vodka and coke.
Remembered.
What am I drinking? Lager? - Pint thereof.
They're coming up to me one at a time and going, 'Will we be made redundant, David?' I'm going, 'No.
Over my dead body.
' They're going, 'Don't put your neck on the line.
' 'I will if I want to.
' They bend over backwards for me, and not because they're scared of me, but because they love me and I love them.
You know? You'll grow to love me as well - not because of anything sexual Hey, David.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, what bike you got? A Matchless 500.
- Is that a Harley Davidson? I love all that.
- Leave it.
Slough's nl'ghtlife is incredible, It's got two nl'ghtclubs - Chasers and New York New York, They call it 'The nightclub that never sleeps.
' That closes at one.
There is There was Oh, my God.
.
.
a themed nightclub called Henry VIII's, right? It was incredible.
It had the Ann Bow-ling Alley.
This is true.
As you went into the loo, there was a sign that said 'Mind Your Head.
' And underneath someone had written 'Don't get your Hampton Court.
' Yeah.
It's not there anymore.
But not a day goes by that I don't think about it.
Who are you? Have you not met my husband Paul? Husband? Is it all right if Gareth comes back? Fine.
- Husband? No way.
No.
I don't Not interested.
No.
I'm not having another fella involved.
Another girl, maybe.
I wouldn't even want him watching.
No way.
'TAINTED LOVE' BY SOFT CELL) Hi.
Hey.
All right, mate.
- How's it going? Good to see you.
So now you know.
- Yeah.
Brilliant.
You got a problem with Ricky? No.
Sleep with everyone.
He's not even permanent.
I'd have preferred Gareth.
Wouldn't happen.
- 'Cause he didn't go to university? No, because he's a weasel-faced arse.
You could do worse than Gareth.
He hasn't missed one day from illness.
And don't call him an arse-faced weasel.
A weasel-faced arse.
- Same.
Would you rather have a face like an arse or a face like a weasel? A weasel, probably.
Fuck this.
Don't tell me who I can and can't see.
I hope you won't be sleeping with someone if sex is so disgusting.
Fat chance.
He couldn't pull in a brothel.
I could and I have! I'll take her home if I want.
I don't want to.
- She doesn't want to.
I don't want you to.
That's wasted an hour.
Is that why you've been talking to me - you want to shag me? Yeah, and from behind because your breath stinks of onions.
Whoo! One up the bum, no harm done.
No.
Not up the arse.
This is the poem 'Slough' by Sir John BetJ'eman, Probably never been here, 'Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough.
'It isn't fit for humans now.
' You don't solve town planning problems by dropping bombs, so he's embarrassed himself there.
'In labour-saving homes with care 'Their wives frizz out peroxide hair, 'and dry it in synthetic air, and paint their nails, ' To look nice, Why's he got a? Doesn't he like girls? 'And talk of sports and makes of cars in various bogus Tudor bars, 'and daren't look up and see the stars, but belch instead, ' What's he on about? He's never burped? Where are we going? - What? I'm going home, mate.
One more drink.
- I'm going home, David.
One more drink.
Don't do that.
'Come, friendly bombs, and fall on Slough, 'to get it ready for the plough, 'The cabbages are coming now.
'The earth exhales ' He's the only cabbage.
They made him a knight of the realm.
Overrated.
