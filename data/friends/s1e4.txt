There was ice that night with Carol? Plastic seats? Four thousand angry Pittsburgh fans? No, I was just saying we're not sitting together.
But now that you mention it, there was ice that night.
It was the first frost.
Sit.
Just sit down.
Sit.
You're doing this amazing independent thing.
Monica, what is so amazing? I gave up, like, everything.
And for what? -You are just like Jack.
-Jack from downstairs? No, Jack and the Beanstalk.
Ah, the other Jack.
Right.
He gave up something but then he got those magic beans.
And then he woke up and there was this big plant outside of his window, full of possibilities.
He lived in a village, and you live in the Village.
Okay.
But, Pheebs, Jack gave up a cow.
I gave up an orthodontist.
-Okay, I know I didn't love him.
-Oh, see, Jack did love the cow.
But, see, it was a plan.
It was clear.
Everything was figured out.
Now it's like.
-Floopy? -Yeah.
We don't know where we' re going.
It's all gonna come together and it's just gonna be un-floopy.
Yeah, like that's a word.
Okay.

Hold on.
Fill these out.
Sit over there! I don't want to make any trouble but I'm in a lot of pain.
-My face is dented.
-Well, you'll have to wait your turn.
-How long do you think it will be? -Any minute now.
Hey, this I' m so sorry, you guys.
I didn't mean to bring you down.
No, you were right.
I don't have a plan.
-Pizza guy.
-Food! -Phoebe? -What? -Do you have a plan? -I don't even have a " pla.

Stephanopoulos? Man, my dad's gonna kill me! Wait! Did you say G.
Stephanopoulos? Yeah, this one goes across the street.
I gave him yours.
Bonehead! Bonehead! When you do that, you're only hitting yourself.
Was this a small Mediterranean guy with curiously intelligent good looks? -That sounds right.
-Was he wearing a stunning blue suit? -And a power tie? -No, pretty much just a towel.
-Oh, God! -You guys want me to take this back? What, are you nuts? We've got George Stephanopoulos' pizza! Pheebs, who's George Snuffleupagus? That's Big Bird's friend.
-I see pizza! -I want to see.

-Definitely not his mother.
-Oh, no! Wait, she's walking across the floor.
She's walking, she's walking.
She's going for the pizza That's not for you, bitch! We've been here for over an hour, and people less sick have gone in.
That guy with the toe thing, who's he sleeping with? Oh, come on, Dora.
Don't be mad.
I know we both said some things we didn't mean but that doesn't mean we still don't love each other.
You know, I feel like I've lost her.

-What do you think of the guys? -Our guys? -Yeah, our guys.
-I feel funny talking about that.
-Oh, come on.
-Okay.

I think Joey's like a little kiddie ride.
You just have to put the quarter in and it just goes.
He might surprise you.
One time, he helped me put on my coat and he was really tender.
Come on, baby, come on.
Let's go.
Yes! Chandler's one of those repressed guys who you'd have to seduce.
I think it's an act.
Chandler is more sophisticated than he seems.
-You know who's kind of sexy? -Don't.
-Ross.
-No, guys.
Please, he is my brother.
I know exactly what you mean.
He can be really smooth.
Can't you just picture him in bed? I really don't want to.
Come on, laugh.
Laugh.
I remember the moonlight coming in the window, and her face had the most incredible glow.
The moon, the glow, the magical feeling.
